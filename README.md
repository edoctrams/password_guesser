## What It Does

- You type in a password (letters and numbers).
- The program keeps randomly guessing until it finds the correct password.
- It's a beginner-friendly way to understand how brute-force works in theory.

---

##  How It Works

- Uses a list of lowercase letters and numbers.
- Guesses one character at a time.
- Shows each attempt in the terminal.
- Stops when it guesses the full password correctly.
